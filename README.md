# Unfreeze Seattle

Everyone knows about the so-called "Seattle Freeze". Transplants to Seattle have reported having a difficult time meeting new people when they move here. Part of it might be that making friends as an adult is difficult--period. Part of it might be the city's "cultural introversion". Either way, transplants find themselves on the outside. Unfreeze Seattle aims to change that! By connecting friendly locals with curious transplants, Unfreeze Seattle creates a unique platform for getting to know one another.

## Project Status

Ongoing until Feb 15
